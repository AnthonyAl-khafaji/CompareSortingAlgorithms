# Java Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains Java implementations of Merge Sort and Bubble Sort algorithms. 

- **Merge Sort**: Efficiently sorts an array by dividing it into halves, sorting each half, and merging them.
- **Bubble Sort**: Simple algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.
